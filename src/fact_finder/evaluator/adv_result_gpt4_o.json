    {
        "question": "Which drugs to treat ocular hypertension may cause the loss of eyelashes?",
        "answer": "The drugs used to treat ocular hypertension that may cause the loss of eyelashes include:\n\n1. **Latanoprost**: Latanoprost is a prodrug analog of prostaglandin F2 alpha that is used to treat elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). It was initially approved by the FDA in 1998. Latanoprost is the first topical prostaglandin F2 alpha analog used for glaucoma treatment. It has been found to be well-tolerated and its use does not normally result in systemic adverse effects like other drugs used to treat elevated intraocular pressure.\n\n2. **Bimatoprost**: Bimatoprost, also known as Latisse or Lumigan, belongs to a group of drugs called prostamides, which are synthetic structural analogs of prostaglandin. Bimatoprost, marketed by Allergan, is administered in both the ophthalmic solution and implant form. It has the ability to reduce ocular hypotension, proving effective in conditions such as ocular hypertension and glaucoma. Bimatoprost is also used to treat eyelash hypotrichosis, or sparse eyelash growth. It was initially approved by the FDA in 2001 for ocular hypertension and later approved for hypothrichosis in 2008, as eyelash growth became a desirable adverse effect for patients using this drug.\n\n3. **Travoprost**: Travoprost ophthalmic solution is a topical medication used for controlling the progression of glaucoma or ocular hypertension, by reducing intraocular pressure. It is a synthetic prostaglandin F2alpha analog. Having been a well-received therapeutic agent with demonstrated efficacy and safety, travoprost is currently approved by the US FDA as a first-line treatment for lowering intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypotension. Furthermore, this approval also solidifies the medication as the first and only prostaglandin analog approved by the FDA for first-line treatment of glaucoma patients that does not contain the preservative benzalkonium chloride. Moreover, travoprost is also currently approved in the EU for the decrease of elevated intraocular pressure in paediatric patients aged 2 months to < 18 years with ocular hypertension or paediatric glaucoma.\n\n4. **Tafluprost**: Tafluprost is a novel prostaglandin analog with a high affinity for the fluoroprostaglandin (FP) receptor PGF2Î±. Tafluprost has an affinity for the FP receptor that is approximately 12 times higher than that of the carboxylic acid of latanoprost, but with almost no potential to bind to other receptors. Tafluprost is a prostaglandin analogue ester prodrug used topically (as eye drops) to control the progression of glaucoma and in the management of ocular hypertension. Chemically, tafluprost is a fluorinated analog of prostaglandin F2-alpha. Tafluprost was approved for use in the U.S. on February 10, 2012.",
